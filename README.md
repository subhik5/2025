# 2025

In 2025, I focused on expanding my DevOps skills. I learned networking and Linux to build a solid foundation for system management. 
Git and Git Bash improved my version control, while shell scripting helped me automate tasks efficiently.
I explored Docker for containerization and gained hands-on experience with Jira for project management. 
With Terraform, I learned Infrastructure as Code to manage resources.
Kubernetes allowed me to orchestrate containers at scale.
I also worked with monitoring and configuration management tools, ensuring reliable and consistent systems.
Throughout the year, I practiced scripting to enhance my problem-solving and technical abilities, strengthening my overall DevOps expertise.
